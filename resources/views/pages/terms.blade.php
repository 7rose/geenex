of these Terms and Conditions and are subject to acceptance by the Supplier. No contract for the supply of Goods
(“Contract”) will come into existence until the Supplier despatches the Goods or sends an email to the Customer
confirming that the Goods have been despatched (whichever is earlier). The processing of the Customer’s payment
and acknowledgment of the Customer’s acceptance of the order does not constitute legal acceptance of the
Customer’s order. The Contract will relate only to those goods whose despatch the Supplier has confirmed in such
email. The Supplier will not be obliged to supply any other Goods which may have been part of the Customer’s order
until the dispatch of such Goods has been confirmed in a separate email.<br>

order and any delivery charges applicable before the order can
be processed, unless the Supplier has agreed otherwise in advance in writing.<br>

the date of invoice. Time shall be of the essence for payment. The Supplier may revoke credit if the Customer fails
to make payment when due. If payment is not made when due, interest shall accrue and become payable on all
overdue amounts from the date when payment was due until the date when payment in full is actually made.</p>
    <strong>4 Technical Documents</strong>
    <p>4.1 All specifications, drawings and particulars submitted by the Supplier are approximate only and the descriptions
and illustrations contained in any product supporting literature, including text, pictures and graphics displayed on
the Supplier’s website are intended to present a general idea of the Goods and none of these shall form part of the
Contract. All drawings prepared by the Supplier under the Contract shall remain the property of the Supplier and the
copyright is reserved accordingly. No copies or extracts shall be taken without the Supplier’s prior written consent.</p>

reasonable endeavours to despatch or complete by the dates stated the Supplier will be under no liability
whatsoever for failure to do so. In the unlikely event that the Customer has not received all the Goods within the
estimated delivery time, the Customer must notify the Supplier immediately. The Customer must not schedule or
commence any installation work until after the Customer has received his order and checked all the Goods for any
defects or missing parts.<br>
5.6 Without prejudice to clause 5.3, upon delivery of the Goods to the Customer, the Goods shall be at the
Customer’s risk. In spite of delivery having been made, title in the Goods shall
not pass to the Customer until the price for the Goods has been paid in full and no other sums whatsoever shall be
due to the Supplier from the Customer. Until title in the Goods passes from the Supplier, the Customer shall hold
the Goods on a fiduciary basis as bailee and shall store the Goods at its own cost separately from all other goods in
its possession and marked in such a way that they are clearly identified as the property of the Supplier. The Supplier
